The Dollar Store Shim Operating System
                                 
```

dssOS is an alternative operating system for Chrome OS devices which runs off a modified RMA shim.

> [!WARNING]  
> Warning: dssOS was hacked together in a weekend, and thus is very unstable. Don't come crying to me when something breaks.
